&nbsp;&nbsp;This exploratory data analysis (EDA) investigates the energy consumption and production patterns of a zero-energy commercial building operated by a national non-profit housing provider in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes hourly energy use, monthly energy production, and average weather temperature data spanning multiple years. The study aims to assess energy distribution by category (HVAC, Lighting, Load), annual trends, the effectiveness of the building’s 12.3 kWp solar photovoltaic (PV) system, and the relationship between energy consumption and temperature. The EDA utilizes Microsoft Excel and SQLite for data cleaning and transformation, Python for analysis and visualization, and Gemini for coding assistance.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy consumption trends indicate that lighting consistently consumes the most energy annually, while general load saw the highest growth from 2015 to 2016. Seasonal variations play a significant role in energy demand, with winter months exhibiting higher consumption due to heating needs and lower solar energy production due to reduced daylight hours. The data suggests that an average temperature range of 10°C to 24°C minimizes HVAC energy demand, with heating being more energy-intensive than cooling.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;While the building produces surplus energy for most of the year, it falls into a net negative state during winter. Recommendations include optimizing lighting control systems, implementing motion-sensor-based automation, improving HVAC efficiency, and enrolling in a net metering program to offset winter energy costs.
